            <h2>About Nasa</h2>
            <p class="about">The bloom phenomenon is the stage in a plant’s life cycle when buds open and flowers appear, marking the shift from growth to reproduction. It happens when conditions like light, temperature, and hormones align. Timing is crucial—if flowers bloom too early or too late, they may face frost, lack of pollinators, or shortened growing seasons, all of which reduce reproductive success. Blooming is highly useful: it enables plants to reproduce, provides food for pollinators, supports ecosystems, and benefits humans through agriculture and culture. While it doesn’t directly change the physical environment, it strongly influences ecosystems by attracting pollinators, shaping food chains, and maintaining biodiversity. In short, bloom is both a vital biological process and a driver of ecological balance.</p>
